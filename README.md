In this directory, I try out/implement techniques that I've come across for shot-boundary detection. In the directory `tdk-bankrobbery` I've used `PySceneDetect`, an easy to use, effective tool for detecting hard-cuts.

I find that though most cuts are detected, the exact frame where the cut should have been detected is off by a few frames (like 10-15).

This project was initiated on March 16, 2019 but the content in `tdk-bankrobbery/` was actually generated sometime in September 2018, before I knew how to use github or what git really was.
